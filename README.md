Happy Customer Bank is a mid-sized private bank that deals in all kinds of banking products, like Savings accounts, Current accounts, investment products, credit products, 
among other offerings. The bank also cross-sells products to its existing customers and to do so they use different kinds of communication like tele-calling, e-mails, 
recommendations on net banking, mobile banking, etc. In this case, the Happy Customer Bank wants to cross sell its credit cards to its existing customers. 
The bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards.
Now, the bank is looking for help in identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card, given:
* Customer details (Gender, Age, Region_Code etc.)
* Details of his/her relationship with the bank (Channel_Code, Vintage, Avg_Account_Balance etc.)
